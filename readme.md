## 🎯 Project Objectives

1. Perform comprehensive network scanning and reconnaissance
2. Identify and exploit vulnerabilities in target systems
3. Demonstrate password cracking techniques
4. Implement security remediation measures
5. Document findings and provide security recommendations

## 📚 Introduction

Network penetration testing is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity that helps identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. This project provides hands-on experience with various security tools and techniques used in professional penetration testing.

## 🔬 Theory

The project covers fundamental concepts of:
- Network scanning and reconnaissance
- Port scanning and service enumeration
- Vulnerability assessment
- Exploitation techniques
- Password security and cracking
- Security remediation

## 💻 Project Requirements

### Operating Systems
1. **Kali Linux** (Attacking Machine)
2. **Metasploitable** (Target Machine)

### Tools Used
